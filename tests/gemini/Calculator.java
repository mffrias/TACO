/*store here your opinion about the quality of the generated spec
As expected, the specifications provided by gemini are detailed, it includes preconditions and postconditions. They are less concise, ensuring that the method runs effectively.
Additionally, the JML parser seems to have issues interpreting these specifications.

The code approach for this problem was individually tested, and it works effectively, following the right logic.
